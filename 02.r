#1.- Create a vector with body sizes
#of people around you. You can also
#use the values 1.75, 1.76, 1.83, 1.84, 1.77, 1.76,
#1.77, 1.66, 1.86, 1.76.
#Assign it to an object with a useful name (YourObject is not one!).

classRoomSizes <- c(1.78,1.68,1.67, 1.70, 1.65, 1.62, 1.68, 1.77)

#2.- What does 3:6 create? What does YourObject[3:6] do?
#ans: an array with the elements from 3 to 6

print(classRoomSizes[3:6])

#3.- what does yourObject[-4] do?
#ans: removes the element of the index

print(classRoomSizes[-4])
